		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_INFLUENTIAL_ON_HUMAN_CLASSICAL_1">
			<Text>I am happy to see that you have finally abandoned your miserable, barbaric customs. Do not despair, as it is far better for a culture to die by choice than by the sword ... though yours, perhaps, may succumb to both.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_INFLUENTIAL_ON_HUMAN_RENAISSANCE_1">
			<Text>Do not fear the new way of life that has enthralled your people. You will soon forget all about the backwards and rude traditions you laughably called 'culture.'</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_WORLD_CONQUEST1">
			<Text>This world is not big enough for two would-be conquerors. Though I see that you are on the warpath, I do not fear you or your power. My armies will meet yours on the battlefield soon enough, a challenge that will forever decide the fate of humanity. I can only hope that such a conflict will not destroy us both. Prepare yourself!</Text>

			<Text>Do you hear the footsteps of my armies? Fear me, and fear them, as there cannot be two world conquerors on this day. I seek a place in the sun, an empire that streches around the world. Unfortunately for you, your army stands in my way. Not for long.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_CULTURE1">
			<Text>I received a shipment of your so-called 'cultural artifacts' the other day. How quaint. While you may have swayed a few lesser cultures to your side, you will all soon know the meaning of true culture. Prepare for an onslaught, not of firepower, but of my cultural superiority!</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_CULTURE2">
			<Text>I know you will agree that there are few sights as glorious as that of a foreign army conquering a city full of willing, passive citizens, especially when that army is composed of musicians, artists, and other cultural luminaries. Unfortunately for you, there is only room for one cultural conqueror on this planet. Prepare to be enlightened.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_SPACESHIP1">
			<Text>Though we both stare into the night sky and dream of interstellar empire, historians will remember only one of us for being the first to accomplish such a great task: me. Do not fret, as our mutual love of science need not lead to war. In fact, how would you like a seat on our first spaceship? Being a footnote of history is better than not being remembered at all, right?</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_SPACESHIP2">
			<Text>We shall soon slip the surly bonds of Earth and pierce the heavens in our shiny new rockets. I'm sorry, by 'we' I meant my people, not yours. We shall be the first to Alpha Centauri, this I can promise you. If you insist on racing us, I'll give you this advice: make sure the pointy end of your rocket is facing upwards.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_COMPETITION_ANNOUNCE_CONFUSED1">
			<Text>I have no idea what you are up to, or what kind of mark you are trying to make on history, but know this: we're watching you, and we have our own plans. And they're probably better than yours. Maybe.</Text>

			<Text>One of my historians came by the other day to ask me about you and your impact on world history. Do you want to know what I told him? Nothing, and not for a lack of trying. What are you doing over there, anyways? Feeling a bit listless, maybe?</Text>
